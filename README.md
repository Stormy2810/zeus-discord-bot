# Info 
This was my first official project in learning python for discord, so if anything seems wrong or dumb looking thats why.  
Also I will not update this anymore. I don't care what you do with this but it would be nice if you put me somewhere in the credits :D.
# How to setup
This has no config file so go in the ZeusBot.py file and scroll all the way to the bottom and put in the discord bot token. 
I also don't have a file to automatically install modules because I don't remember wtf I used so please just open up the command prompt and run the file and it will show you whats wrong with the bot and what modules to install for it to work.
